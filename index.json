New and powerful models are released on a weekly basis, demonstrating remarkable performance on the code generation task. In this article, I curate some SOTA models and try to figure out their machanism. Here is the content of table:\nContents Datasets HumanEval Models CodeLlama Phind CodeGeex Codeium WizardCode phi-1 CodeFuse HumanEval This is an evaluation harness for the HumanEval problem solving dataset described in the paper “Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code”. It used to measure functional correctness for synthesizing programs from docstrings. It consists of 164 original programming problems, assessing language comprehension, algorithms, and simple mathematics, with some comparable to simple software interview questions. At the same time, you can find the latest models and advancements in PapersWithCode. An example: the white space is the prompt or input while the yellow space is the model-generated content CodeLlama Maybe you haven’t excperienced CodeLlama yet, the Huggingface official group has deployed a playground for everyone where you can Preliminarily evaluate it in your target task.\nAfter you have seen its performance on your task and gain much confidence in CodeLlama, you might want to give it a shot where you can delve deeper into the paper, even deploy and finetune it. The model weights are available in Huggingface. If you go through the paper, you might find a really distinct model named “unnatural CodeLlama” whose performance is nearly the same as GPT-4 under the code scenario.\nWhat is unnatural instruction In December 2022, Meta AI with Tel Aviv University published the paper named Unnatural Instructions: Tuning Language Models with (Almost) No Human Labor. The paper talks about how Meta created a large dataset of creative and diverse instructions and collected 64,000 examples by prompting a language model. This was then further prompted to create a total of 240,000 examples on inputs and outputs, which contained only a little amount of noise. Unnatural Instructions is a dataset of instructions automatically generated by a Large Language model.\nAn example of dataset:\n{ \u0026#39;instruction\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;You will be given a series of words. Output these words in reverse order, with each word on its own line.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;instances\u0026#39;: [{ \u0026#39;instruction_with_input\u0026#39;: \u0026#34;You will be given a series of words. Output these words in reverse order, with each word on its own line.\\nWords: [\u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;world\u0026#39;].\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;input\u0026#39;: \u0026#34;Words: [\u0026#39;Hello\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;world\u0026#39;].\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;constraints\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;None.\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;output\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;world\\nHello\u0026#39; }] } Codeium CodeGeeX2 CodeGeeX2 是多语言代码生成模型 CodeGeeX (KDD’23) 的第二代模型。不同于一代 CodeGeeX（完全在国产华为昇腾芯片平台训练） ，CodeGeeX2 是基于 ChatGLM2 架构加入代码预训练实现，得益于 ChatGLM2 的更优性能，CodeGeeX2 在多项指标上取得性能提升（+107% \u0026gt; CodeGeeX；仅60亿参数即超过150亿参数的 StarCoder-15B 近10%）\nWizardCode Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs), such as StarCoder, have demonstrated exceptional performance in code-related tasks. However, most existing models are solely pre-trained on extensive raw code data without instruction fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce WizardCoder, which empowers Code LLMs with complex instruction fine-tuning, by adapting the Evol-Instruct method to the domain of code. Through comprehensive experiments on four prominent code generation benchmarks, namely HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, and DS-1000, we unveil the exceptional capabilities of our model. It surpasses all other open-source Code LLMs by a substantial margin. Moreover, our model even outperforms the largest closed LLMs, Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Bard, on HumanEval and HumanEval+.\nphi-1 phi-1 is proposed by teams of Microsoft in the \u0026#34;Textbooks Are All You Need\u0026#34;. phi-1 is a Transformer-based model with 1.3B parameters, trained for 4 days on 8 A100s, using a selection of “textbook quality” data from the web (6B tokens) and synthetically generated textbooks and exercises with GPT-3.5 (1B tokens). Despite this small scale, phi-1 attains pass@1 accuracy 50.6% on HumanEval and 55.5% on MBPP. It also displays surprising emergent properties compared to phi-1-base, our model before our finetuning stage on a dataset of coding exercises, and phi-1-small, a smaller model with 350M parameters trained with the same pipeline as phi-1 that still achieves 45% on HumanEval. Phind Phind is an intelligent search engine and assistant for programmers. With Phind, you’ll get the answer you’re looking for in seconds instead of hours. It will guide you step-by-step from that idea in your head to a working app. Phind is smart enough to proactively ask you questions to clarify its assumptions and to browse the web (or your codebase) when it needs additional context. With their new VS Code extension, you can now get Phind’s help right in your editor.\nAugust 28th Update: They’ve trained a new model, Phind-CodeLlama-34B-v2, that achieves 73.8% pass@1 on HumanEval. See the blog.\nThey have released all models on Huggingface to bolster the open-source community.\nVscode Plugin with …","date":1697292600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697292600,"objectID":"202b33df4b32c41aa6f167b7fa44ebf5","permalink":"https://jiwenj.github.io/blog/llm4code/","publishdate":"2023-10-14T21:10:00+07:00","relpermalink":"/blog/llm4code/","section":"blog","summary":"I have curated some recent LLMs for code generation task.","tags":["CodeLlama","Finetune","LLM"],"title":"LLMs for Code (Progressing)","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Jiwen Jiang"],"categories":["Tools","Utility"],"content":"\rWebsite development\nGoogle Fonts\nGoogle documentation guide\nGoogle Style Guides\nHTML特殊字符符号大全\nMDN\nAutoDL\n学术资源加速 Huggingface\nHugging Face Hub 模型下载方案\ngit clone下载\n国内模型下载\nmindspore Huggingface 镜像站 modelee 异型岛 书籍查找下载\nGitHub jiumodiary Z-Library Library Genesis 论文查找，期刊查询\nGoogle Scholar DBLP LetPub Web of Science 会伴 ResearchGate Sci-Hub Elsevier-ScienceDirect Aminer Academia.edu Microsoft Academic Semantic Scholar 博客、学术网站搭建\nblinkfox 魔法之书 文件转换\nPandoc 软件，AI服务\nai-lib.club mpyit Latex\nOnline Editor\nOverleaf Curriculum Vitae\ncanadacast-cv-example A latex cv/resume template 📄 适合中文的简历模板收集 Helpful Documentation\nLaTeX公式手册 lshort-zh-cn lnotes 刘海洋 LaTeX 工作室 Linux\nLinux命令搜索引擎 Windows\nwindows常用命令 Manim\nmanim中文入门教程 eulertour.com/studio 论文绘图\nPPT Draw.io Visio R Python 云服务器\nAutoDL AWS 代码，模型社区\nGitHub Huggingface ApacheCN 前沿消息\nTwitter Reddit Telegram Medium 信用卡\nvisa credit card Dupay OKX Math\nLibrary Genesis • scientific articles 中文数学 Wiki Swift\nA Swift Tour | Documentation ","date":1697292600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697292600,"objectID":"8a3943386d7cb04dc20f039e800f0f98","permalink":"https://jiwenj.github.io/blog/utils/","publishdate":"2023-10-14T21:10:00+07:00","relpermalink":"/blog/utils/","section":"blog","summary":"I summarize some useful utilities for personal usage.","tags":["Tools","Utility"],"title":"Utility","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":["LLM","RL"],"content":"","date":1689588047,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689588047,"objectID":"9f39ae9c9d4d2de34a1ac48d650efc92","permalink":"https://jiwenj.github.io/paperreview/1/","publishdate":"2023-07-17T18:00:47+08:00","relpermalink":"/paperreview/1/","section":"paperreview","summary":"","tags":["LLM","RL"],"title":"Supervised Pretraining Can Learn In-Context Reinforcement Learning","type":"paperreview"},{"authors":["Jiwen Jiang"],"categories":["LLM","Prompt"],"content":"Group Meeting PPT ","date":1685974200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689516600,"objectID":"5e8b803a3fc72c7bb4e3baca1239faec","permalink":"https://jiwenj.github.io/blog/prompt-engineering/","publishdate":"2023-06-05T21:10:00+07:00","relpermalink":"/blog/prompt-engineering/","section":"blog","summary":"I summarize some prompt techniques that facilitate the utility of LLMs.","tags":["LLM","Prompt"],"title":"Prompt Engineering for LLMs","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
